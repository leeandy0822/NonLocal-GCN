# NonLocal-GCN

In this work, we present non-local operator combination with the GCN network for mnist number classification.
We want to test the difference and the performance of different non-local operator comparing to the classifcal GCN network.

# Usage
- install pytorch-geometric (You may need to use conda)

- The training code is inside train.py , you can change the network architecture if you want
